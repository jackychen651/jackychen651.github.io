I am currently a master student major in Statistics in [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/), [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). 

My life goal is to simulate natural phenomenon on modern computer, ranging from physics and chemistry to biology and astrology. Besides my great ambition, I have been interested in fast algorithms, scientific computing and some topics in statistics.

During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to finish my thesis under the guidance of [Weiguo Gao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weiguo-Gao). And during my master, I was fortunate to meet [Jeremy Hoskins](https://www.jghoskins.com/) in the course Fast Algorithms, who had a great influence on my current research interest.
